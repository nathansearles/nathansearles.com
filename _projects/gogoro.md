# Gogoro

## Launch Website

Over a year in the making, involving all disciplines in the studio, Gogoro was a monumental effort. I was tasked with building a feature rich site that told the story behind Gogoro and highlighted the engineering beauty that goes into a Gogoro Scooter.

Not only was this site forward thinking and pushed what could be done on the web at the time, it also needed to work in Internet Explorer 9. I developed thinking that helped the site run full featured on modern browsers and devices yet seamlessly degrade to not so great browsers and smaller screens. The result was a rich storytelling experience that felt great no matter the device or browser the user was experiencing it on.
