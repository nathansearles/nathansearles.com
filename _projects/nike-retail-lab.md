# Nike Retail Lab

## Prototyping, NFC, Streaming Video

To introduce the Nike Connected Jersey, we partnered with Nike Global Basketball to create, prototype, and prove out a complete digital and physical system in the Nike Retail Lab, then helped to bring the experience to the world.

Our goal was to create a seamless user experience driven by technology. Factoring in the variables within a retail environment. The experience needed to quickly load the highest quality video to help drive consumer engagement.
