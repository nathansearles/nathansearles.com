# Better Together

## Interactive experience

For Design Week Portland 2017 we wanted to throw an epic party and invite the design community to take part. We set out to bring together all disciplines at Cinco and highlight our extended capabilities. The result was an experience that blended the ambient with the interactive, massive scale with attention to the smallest details, and a dynamically personal experience with a community gathering.
