# The James Brand

## Website, eComm, DevOps

Focused on digital storytelling we created a shoppable brand experience that helps customers understand the growing catalog of products and experience the brand as a whole. The product stories feature the products through the people that use them. The shop allows users to quickly configure products and easily move through the checkout flow.

The site utilizes a combination of Craft for content management and Shopify for product management. To better manage content within the product detail pages we used Craftâ€™s REST API. This allowed us to create variant specific content, like descriptions, specs and allowed for easier management of hi-res images within the Shop experience. For optimal performance we custom built a DigitalOcean server and used Imgix CDN to help push beautiful hi-res photography and keep the site running smooth no matter the device.
