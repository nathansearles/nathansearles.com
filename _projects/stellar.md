# Stellar

## Website

A studio wide collaboration brought together strategy, copywriting, design, motion graphics, and development to create a highly refined story that contained substance and was artfully crafted. I lead frontend development partnering with design and the motion teams to prototype creative approaches to telling the Stellar story. We landed on using SVG animations to show the algorithmic thinking behind Stellar's product.
