        I thrive at the intersection of design and development, translating

      <p class="text-muted text-lg">
        My approach is collaborative and detail-oriented. I like to be involved
        early, working closely with designers, strategists, and clients to shape
        the vision and define what&rsquo;s possible. I think through
        performance, accessibility, and responsiveness from the start, so the
        end product feels smooth, fast, and inclusive.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted text-lg">
        I care a lot about design fidelity, making sure what gets built reflects
        the original intent, down to the interactions and spacing. I also think
        systemically, building reusable components and scalable front-end
        foundations that are easy to maintain and extend.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted text-lg">
        Whether I&rsquo;m writing code, reviewing work, or guiding a team, I
        focus on clear communication, efficient workflows, and delivering
        high-quality work that holds up under real-world conditions.
