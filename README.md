# Personal Website

My personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## About

I'm a design engineer and tech lead building interfaces that feel great to use, whether I’m in the code or leading a project. I’m all about the details, clean UI, smooth UX and a balance of design and dev.
